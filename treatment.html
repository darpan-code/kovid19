                    or
                    treat COVID-2019.</span> However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People
                with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. <br> <br>

                Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms
                while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you
                have recovered.</P>
